MeshCMS requires an application server compatible with the Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 specifications. Some examples of such a server are Tomcat and Jetty.

Pages can be edited with all major browsers, with **JavaScript and cookies enabled**. Note that you might need to **allow popups** from the site being edited, otherwise you won't be able to use the File Browser from within the editor.
