    works. Some come from external sites:

    
      - 

          **A real-life example** ([www.natural.it](http://www.natural.it/))  

           this site has an intro and a menu made with Isaac. The menu is more
          significant, since it shows some of the advantages of this
          program:  

           - the menu has a simple animation, then it shows a rollover
          effect;  

           - the current page is highlighted automatically;  

           - once loaded for the first time, the menu remains available for the
          other pages;  

           - an animated GIF with an associated map of links is provided as an
          alternative.
        

      - [A slideshow](slideshow.html)  

       images are loaded only when needed. It is easy to add links to big
      images.

          [A simple banner](banner.html)  

           a simple animation in the standard banner size. Isaac creates a GIF
          version for users that disabled Java in their browsers. See it [here](banner1_map.gif).

          [Isaac introduces itself
          (3.0)](window3.html)  

           as above, but simpler. This animation is included in the program
          help.
