    [screenshots](screenshots), its [gallery](gallery/)
    and then [download it for free](download)!

    Isaac can split images in smaller pieces, change their colors and use
    them to generate any animations, interactive effects, rollovers, menus and
    other interesting effects. It allows you to achieve great results without
    increasing loading time of your pages.

    This is a brief list of main Isaac features & benefits:

    
      - **it runs on all browser and computers**  

         

        

          All browsers offer Java support. If users have it enabled, animations
          are rendered with Java. Otherwise, an animated GIF is provided. Isaac
          generates both formats automatically. The GIF version includes a map
          with fully functional links.
        

      - **it doesn't need any plug-in or installation**  

         

        

          The browser will download a small Java Applet (8 kb only), as little
          as those applets that display no more than scrolling text.
        

      - **you can group many images in one**  

         

        

          Images will be split by Isaac, reducing download time dramatically.
          This is more efficient than the JavaScript approach.
        

      - **you don't need to write code**  

         

        

          Isaac is completely visual ([screenshots](screenshots)).
          It produces HTML files that can be copied or inserted into your
          website.
