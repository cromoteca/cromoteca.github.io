Development on MeshCMS 4 is progressing well. The core functionality is now working, including:

- creation of a new page
- page editing
- switching between draft and published version of the page
- usage of modules
- file manager with integrated control panel
- drag & drop to order pages and modules

The application is currently running in GWT development mode. There is still a lot of work to do before it can be released, but the fundamental architecture and major features are now in place.
