I'm quite busy on MeshCMS these days. MeshCMS 3.5 is around the corner, with a new license (GPL 3), an RSS feed tag and some improvements to Blog and Comments. On the other side, I keep working on MeshCMS 4: here's a screenshot of the file manager in GWT as it looks now.

It's quite primitive yet, but fully working. Now it's time to get back to work on the core.
