MeshCMS 4 is now serving this website, and the current code is [published on SVN](http://sourceforge.net/projects/meshcms/develop) (in trunk). There's much work to do before making a release though:

- fix bugs
- add missing features
- write code comments
- write documentation

Due to the slow development pace, all this will require months, but at least the MeshCMS 4 era has begun. I find it much more enjoyable than MeshCMS 3.x. For example, the file manager is much faster and creating and adding modules to pages is a pleasure now. And finally I can write this page and test it before making it visible to the public, a feature that MeshCMS has missed for years.

MeshCMS 3 is very stable and has good documentation. It won't be easy to match that level for MeshCMS 4, so any help is appreciated.
