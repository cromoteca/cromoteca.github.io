# Testing Automated Deployment

This is a test post to verify that our GitHub Actions workflow is working correctly.

## What Should Happen

When this Markdown file is committed and pushed to the main branch:

1. **GitHub Actions detects** the change in `src/posts/`
2. **Automatically runs** `npm run build:posts`
3. **Generates HTML** in `dist/posts/test-automation.html`
4. **Deploys the site** to GitHub Pages
5. **Updates the live site** within 1-2 minutes

## Automation Benefits

- âœ… **No manual builds** required
- âœ… **Always in sync** with source
- âœ… **Fast deployment** process
- âœ… **Version controlled** workflow

## Testing This Post

If you're reading this on the live GitHub Pages site (not localhost), then the automation is working perfectly! ðŸŽ‰

The post was written in simple Markdown and automatically converted to a fully-themed HTML page with:
- Red color coding (updates category)
- Proper navigation and styling
- Responsive design
- Syntax highlighting support

## Next Steps

Now you can:
1. Write new posts in `src/posts/`
2. Commit and push changes
3. Watch GitHub Actions build and deploy automatically
4. See updates live on your site
